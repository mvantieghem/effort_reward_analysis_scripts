# How to use rsynch data 
## moving data from elvis to habanero 
### specifically, synch effort data to run level1 & level2 on habanero

# some impt notes:
### 1. n = dry run which will tell you pretend version of synching data,
### which gives lots of info in terminal to check before actually synching. 
### delete the n when you're ready to actually synch the data.

### 2. use 'habaxfer' instead of 'habanero': allows files to transfer much faster.

### 3. always run this command  *from* elvis terminal, not habanero terminal. 

### 4. don't actually run this rmd file, copy and paste code into terminal

### 5. this can take a really long time to synch, run with nohup! 
e.g. nohup rsynch command & tail -f nohup.out 

### from elvis to habanero
```{bash}
# copy all stuff in "derivatives" folder on elvis and move it to same place on habanero.
rsync -nrlv  /danl/PACCT/subject_data/effort_reward/* mrv2115@habaxfer:/rigel/psych/users/mrv2115/PACCT/subject_data/effort_reward/
```
