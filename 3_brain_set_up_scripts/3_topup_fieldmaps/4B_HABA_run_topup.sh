# Michelle's scripts for converting topup scans into magnitude and fieldmap images 
# output files can then be used as input files in B0 unwarping step in FEAT preprocessing 
# used to improve registration and maybe drop out

# NOTES 
# this script only performs first 2 steps! 
# merges PA + AP scans, and then runs top-up with sbatch (because top-up takes forever)
# final steps are in next script: 4D_prep_topup_output_for_FEAT.sh
